# Contrastive Metric Distillation

Code for the paper "Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making." [arxiv 2406.17098](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098v1)


## Installation

1. Build conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate metrics`
3. Install pip dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps`
4. Export environment variables
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib
```


## Running experiments
